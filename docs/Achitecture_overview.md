## Architecture Overview

The **Modular Media Streaming Suite** is built to be **modular**, **extensible**, and **easy to maintain**.  
It separates media sources, rendering engines, feature plugins, and playlist management into distinct components for better flexibility and scalability.

### Key Components

- **App** — Main entry point that starts and manages the media suite.  
- **MediaComponent (Interface)** — Defines basic playback behavior for all media elements.  
- **MediaItem** — Represents a single playable media item; connects to source, renderer, and plugins.  
- **Playlist** — Uses the **Composite Pattern** to manage single media items or nested playlists.  
- **MediaSource (Interface)** — Provides access to media data (e.g., `LocalFileSource`, `RemoteStreamSource`, `HlsStreamSource`).  
- **ProxyMediaSource** — Applies the **Proxy Pattern** to handle caching and improve performance.  
- **MediaRenderer (Abstraction)** — Uses the **Bridge Pattern** to separate rendering logic from its engine implementation.  
- **RenderingEngine (Interface)** — Defines concrete engines like `CPURenderingEngine` and `GPURenderingEngine`.  
- **PluginChain** — Manages and applies multiple feature plugins during playback.  
- **Plugin (Interface)** — Uses the **Decorator Pattern** to add features dynamically (e.g., `SubtitlePlugin`, `EqualizerPlugin`, `WatermarkPlugin`).  

### Benefits

- **Flexibility** — Easily add new sources, renderers, or plugins.  
- **Maintainability** — Each component has a single, clear responsibility.  
- **Scalability** — Supports nested playlists, multiple renderers, and runtime feature toggling.  
- **Reusability** — Interfaces and abstractions promote clean, reusable design.
